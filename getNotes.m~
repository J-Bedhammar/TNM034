function [noteArray, reImage] = getNotes(staffLineArray)
% Author: Emma Weberyd
% Takes in the staff and outputs all the music elements in an array where the
% notes are grabbed left to right, and top to bottom.

% staffLineArray: array of images that each represent one staff line going
% from top to bottom of the page. They need to be separated since the
% labeling will pic up notes in the wrong order if the image is kept as a
% whole.
% noteArray: an array of the labeled music information in the image.
% reImage: an image that is put together again from staffLineArray but with
% labeled information.
